# Expo Nordic DFU

*Note*: First release is not out yet!

This project was highly inspired by the original React Native project at [Pilloxa/react-native-nordic-dfu](https://github.com/Pilloxa/react-native-nordic-dfu). We continued the work so it functions with modern [Expo](http://expo.dev/) projects that use [Expo Modules](https://docs.expo.dev/modules/overview/).

This module allows you to perform a Device Firmware Update (DFU) for Nordic Semiconductors on Expo React Native bridgeless projects. It wraps the official libraries at [NordicSemiconductor/Android-DFU-Library](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/Android-DFU-Library) and [NordicSemiconductor/IOS-DFU-Library](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/IOS-DFU-Library).

Our intention is to maintain this code for modern Expo projects only. We will not officially support old Expo SDKs. Please keep in mind the our availability to maintain this fork is limited and is based on our project needs.

## Requirements

- Android 14 or 15
- iOS 17 or 18
- Expo SDK 52
- React Native Bridgeless (new architecture) enabled
