# Expo Nordic DFU

This project was highly inspired by the original React Native project at [Pilloxa/react-native-nordic-dfu](https://github.com/Pilloxa/react-native-nordic-dfu). We continued the work so it functions with modern [Expo](http://expo.dev/) projects that use [Expo Modules](https://docs.expo.dev/modules/overview/).

This module allows you to perform a Device Firmware Update (DFU) for Nordic Semiconductors on Expo React Native projects.

Please keep in mind the our availability to maintain this fork is limited and is based on our project needs.
